# bootstrap-pypkg

Minimal CLI to help create new python packages

## Install

`pip install git+https://github.com/raybuhr/bootstrap-pypkg.git`

## Usage

Typically, it is good habit to have a workspace for python projects. 
If you have one, `cd` into it. If you do not, make one, e.g. `mkdir ~/python` and then `cd python`. 

From your python project workspace, you can bootstrap a new python package with

`python -m bootstrap`
